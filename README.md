# Obstacle Avoidance Drone using UltraSonic Sensors


## Overview

This project focuses on building an obstacle avoidance drone equipped with UltraSonic sensors and controlled by a Pixhawk flight controller. The drone uses an Arduino for serial communication to process sensor data and make real-time decisions to avoid obstacles. This repository contains all the necessary files, code, and documentation required to set up and operate the drone.

## UltraSonic Sensors
### Components
- **Transmitter**: The transmitter emits ultrasonic waves at a frequency typically around 40 kHz.
- **Receiver**: The receiver detects the reflected ultrasonic waves (echo) that bounce back from obstacles.
- **Control Circuit**: Manages the timing and processing of the ultrasonic pulses and echoes.
- **Power Supply**: Provides the necessary voltage and current to operate the sensor.

### Working
1. **Emission of Ultrasonic Pulse**:
The transmitter generates a short ultrasonic pulse that travels through the air.

2. **Propagation**:
The ultrasonic pulse propagates away from the sensor. If there are no obstacles, it continues until it dissipates.

3. **Reflection**:
When the ultrasonic pulse encounters an obstacle, it reflects back toward the sensor.

4. **Reception**:
The receiver detects the reflected pulse and converts it into an electrical signal.

5. **Distance Calculation**:
The control circuit measures the time interval between the emission of the pulse and the reception of the echo. The distance to the obstacle is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Speed of Sound} \times \text{Time}}{2}
\]
â€‹
This formula accounts for the round-trip travel time of the ultrasonic pulse.

The Arduino collects data from the UltraSonic sensors, processes the information to determine the distance to obstacles, and communicates this data to the Pixhawk flight controller. The Pixhawk then makes real-time adjustments to the drone's flight path to avoid collisions.

## Basic Drone Parts
### 1. Propellers
Propellers are crucial components that generate the thrust needed for the drone to lift off the ground and maneuver. Drones typically have two types of propellers: clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW), which help in stabilizing and controlling the drone's flight.

### 2. Motors
Brushless motors are used to spin the propellers at high speeds. Each propeller is connected to a motor, and the motors are controlled by electronic speed controllers (ESCs).

### 3. Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)
ESCs regulate the speed of the motors by varying the power supplied to them. They receive signals from the flight controller and adjust the motor speeds accordingly to control the drone's movement and stability.

### 4. Battery
The battery provides the necessary power for all the drone's components, including the motors, flight controller, and sensors. Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries are commonly used due to their high energy density and lightweight properties.

### 5. Power Distribution Board (PDB)
The PDB distributes power from the battery to the various components of the drone, such as the ESCs and flight controller. It ensures that each component receives the appropriate voltage and current.

### 6. Receiver
The receiver is connected to the flight controller and receives control signals from the transmitter (remote control). It allows the pilot to control the drone remotely by sending commands to the flight controller.

### 7. Transmitter
The transmitter is a handheld device used by the pilot to control the drone. It sends control signals to the receiver, which are then passed on to the flight controller to execute the pilot's commands.

### 8. Frame
The drone frame provides the structural support for all the components. It is typically made of lightweight materials such as carbon fiber or plastic to minimize weight while ensuring durability.
