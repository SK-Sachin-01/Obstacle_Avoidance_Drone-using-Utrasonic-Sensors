# Obstacle Avoidance Drone using UltraSonic Sensors


## Overview

This project focuses on building an obstacle avoidance drone equipped with UltraSonic sensors and controlled by a Pixhawk flight controller. The drone uses an Arduino for serial communication to process sensor data and make real-time decisions to avoid obstacles. This repository contains all the necessary files, code, and documentation required to set up and operate the drone.
